## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic implementation plan to evolve the AI Engine into a fully autonomous, enterprise-ready intelligent automation platform. Based on the comprehensive feedback and specifications provided, this roadmap prioritizes the most critical enhancements to deliver a robust, scalable, and cost-efficient solution.

The plan is structured into four two-week sprints, each focusing on a distinct set of features, from real-time user experience enhancements to advanced AI-driven optimizations and cloud-native architecture.

## 2. Phase 1: Foundational Enhancements (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Implement the most critical user-facing features to enhance usability and provide a transparent, interactive workflow creation experience.

| Deliverable | Priority | Technical Requirements & Implementation Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1. Real-time Action Box Visualization** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Backend:** Implement the `real_time_router.py` with WebSocket support. Integrate with the `AILearningEngine` to stream newly generated action steps as they are analyzed. <br> - **Frontend:** Create a `useWebSocket` custom hook in React. The `RecordingPage` will connect to the `/ws/recording/{task_id}` endpoint and dynamically render action boxes on the editor canvas. |
| **1.2. Explicit IPO Data Model** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Backend:** Update the `Workflow` model in `ai_engine/models/workflow.py` to include the explicit `StepIPO` structure for each step. Ensure the API endpoints for creating/updating workflows can handle this nested JSON structure. <br> - **Docs:** Create `documentation/explicit_IPO_format.md` to formally define the schema. |
| **1.3. Frontend IPO Editor** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Frontend:** Enhance the `VisualWorkflowEditor`'s properties panel (`NodePropertiesPanel.jsx`). Create distinct text areas or structured forms for `Input`, `Process`, and `Output` for each selected node, allowing users to clearly define and edit each stage. |
| **1.4. Robust Error Handling & Retries** | ðŸŸ¢ **Medium** | - **Backend:** Update the Celery task runner (`ai_engine/tasks.py`) to include `try/except` blocks for each step execution. Implement `max_retries=3` and `default_retry_delay` on the Celery task decorator. Log all errors to the `Execution` model. |

---

## 3. Phase 2: Cloud Autonomy & Metrics (Weeks 3-4)

**Goal:** Make the platform robust, scalable, and measurable for production environments. This phase focuses on enabling true autonomous execution and providing deep insights into performance.

| Deliverable | Priority | Technical Requirements & Implementation Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1. Production Docker & K8s Config** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Infrastructure:** Create `infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml` optimized for production (e.g., without live reloading). <br> - **Kubernetes:** Develop Kubernetes manifests (`infrastructure/k8s/`) for the API deployment, Celery workers, and a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (`hpa.yaml`) targeting 50% CPU utilization. |
| **2.2. Prometheus & Grafana Integration** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Backend:** Implement `ai_engine/metrics_instrumentation.py` with Prometheus counters and histograms. Use `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` in `main.py` to expose the `/metrics` endpoint. <br> - **Monitoring:** Create `monitoring/prometheus.yml` for configuration and develop starter dashboard templates in `monitoring/grafana/` for visualizing key metrics. |
| **2.3. Instrument Core Logic** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Backend:** Integrate the helper functions from `metrics_instrumentation.py` into the `WorkflowEngine` and task runners to record execution status, duration, and LLM token usage. |
| **2.4. Cloud Deployment Guide** | ðŸŸ¢ **Medium** | - **Docs:** Write a comprehensive `documentation/cloud_deployment_guide.md` detailing the steps to deploy the platform on a major cloud provider (e.g., GCP, AWS) using the created Docker/Kubernetes files. |

## 4. Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence & Cost Optimization (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal:** Enhance the platform's intelligence with predictive capabilities and reduce operational costs by leveraging open-source models and efficient resource management.

| Deliverable | Priority | Technical Requirements & Implementation Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1. Open-Source LLM Integration** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Backend:** In `llm_runner.py`, add a new provider class for an open-source model (e.g., `OllamaProvider` for Llama3/Mistral). Ensure the `LLMFactory` can instantiate it. This involves making HTTP requests to a local Ollama server. <br> - **Cost:** This directly addresses cost optimization by reducing reliance on paid APIs. |
| **3.2. Workflow Versioning & Rollbacks** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Backend:** Introduce a `version` field and a `parent_workflow_id` to the `Workflow` model. When a workflow is saved, create a new version instead of overwriting. <br> - **Frontend:** The UI needs a "Version History" tab in the `WorkflowDetailPage` to view and revert to previous versions. |
| **3.3. Predictive Scheduling Engine** | ðŸŸ¢ **Medium** | - **Backend:** Implement the `ai_engine/predictive_scheduler.py` stub. Create a new model to store historical run times and statuses. The scheduler will run as a separate process, analyzing this data to adjust scheduled job timings via the `schedule` library. |
| **3.4. Spot/Preemptible Instance Strategy** | ðŸŸ¢ **Medium** | - **Docs & Infra:** Document a strategy in the deployment guide for using AWS Spot Instances or GCP Preemptible VMs for Celery workers. This involves configuring Kubernetes node pools to tolerate these instance types for non-critical, fault-tolerant tasks. |

## 5. Phase 4: Enterprise Polish & Future-Proofing (Weeks 7-8)

**Goal:** Add a final layer of enterprise-grade features that enhance user experience, improve management, and set the stage for future AI advancements.

| Deliverable | Priority | Technical Requirements & Implementation Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4.1. Natural Language Workflow Editing** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Frontend:** Add a chat-like input in the `VisualWorkflowEditor`. <br> - **Backend:** Create a new API endpoint that takes a natural language command (e.g., "Add a step to email the report to finance") and uses an LLM to translate it into a valid `StepIPO` JSON object, which is then added to the workflow. |
| **4.2. Advanced Scenario Simulation** | ðŸŸ¢ **Medium** | - **Frontend:** Add a "Simulate" button to the editor. This will trigger a "dry run" execution on the backend. <br> - **Backend:** The `WorkflowEngine` needs a `dry_run` mode that executes the workflow logic but uses mocked runners to avoid performing real actions, returning the expected data flow and outcomes. |
| **4.3. AI-Powered Optimization Insights** | ðŸŸ¢ **Medium** | - **Backend:** Create a new background task that analyzes the metrics data (e.g., frequently failing steps, long-running steps). <br> - **Frontend:** Display these insights on the `DashboardPage` (e.g., "Recommendation: Add a retry mechanism to the 'Invoice Upload' step, which fails 15% of the time."). |
| **4.4. Final Documentation Review** | ðŸ”¥ **High** | - **Docs:** Review and update all documentation, including API references, user guides, and architectural diagrams, to reflect the final, complete state of the platform. |
