# AI Engine: Execution Architecture Guide

This document explains how the AI Engine executes your automated workflows, detailing the different execution environments and answering the critical question: **"Does my computer need to be on?"**

The AI Engine is designed with a flexible, hybrid architecture to handle any automation scenario. There are two primary execution models:

1.  **Cloud-Based Execution**: For web, API, and cloud application tasks. **Your laptop can be turned off.**
2.  **Local Agent Execution**: For tasks involving desktop applications installed on your computer. **Your laptop must be on.**

## üåê Model 1: Cloud-Based Execution (Default & Recommended)

This is the primary execution model for the AI Engine. Your workflows run on secure, scalable cloud servers, which we call **"Cloud Workers"** or **"Digital Employees"**.

### How It Works

When you trigger a workflow that involves web browsing, API calls, or interacting with cloud software (like Office 365, Salesforce, etc.), the AI Engine executes it entirely within our cloud infrastructure.

    end

    subgraph AI Engine Cloud Platform
        B[Dashboard UI & API]
        C[Workflow Orchestrator]
        D[ü§ñ Cloud Worker Fleet]
        E[Headless Browsers & API Clients]
    end
    
    subgraph Target Applications
        F[Public Websites / Web Apps]
        G[Third-Party APIs]
        H[Cloud Software (e.g., O365)]
    end

    A -- "Start Workflow 'Process Invoices'" --> B
    B -- "Trigger Workflow #123" --> C
    C -- "Assigns Job" --> D
    D -- "Executes Steps" --> E
    E -- "Interacts with..." --> F
    E -- "Calls..." --> G
    E -- "Connects to..." --> H
```

### Key Characteristics

-   **Laptop Status**: **OFF**. Your computer is only needed to create, manage, and monitor the workflows via the web dashboard. The execution itself is 100% cloud-based and runs 24/7, regardless of your local machine's status.
-   **Scalability**: We can run thousands of workflows in parallel by scaling the number of Cloud Workers.
-   **Security**: All operations run in an isolated, secure cloud environment. Your local machine is never directly exposed.
-   **Best For**:
    -   Automating tasks in web-based applications (CRMs, ERPs, etc.).
    -   Integrating with third-party APIs.
    -   Processing data from cloud sources.
    -   Running scheduled tasks at any time, day or night.

## üñ•Ô∏è Model 2: Local Agent Execution (For Desktop Apps)

For workflows that need to interact with software installed *only on your computer* (like a legacy accounting application or a specific version of Excel), the AI Engine uses a secure **Local Agent**.

### How It Works

The Local Agent is a small, secure application you install on your computer. When a workflow needs to perform a desktop action, the cloud orchestrator sends a secure command to the Local Agent, which then executes the mouse and keyboard actions on your machine.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph AI Engine Cloud Platform
        A[Workflow Orchestrator]
    end

    subgraph Your Local Environment
        B[User's Laptop (Must be ON)]
        C[üîí AI Engine Local Agent]
        D[üñ±Ô∏è Keyboard & Mouse Control]
        E[üè¢ Desktop Application (e.g., QuickBooks Desktop)]
    end

    A -- "Securely sends command: 'Click Save Button'" --> C
    C -- "Executes on your machine" --> D
    D -- "Performs click" --> E
```

### Key Characteristics

-   **Laptop Status**: **ON**. Your computer must be turned on, logged in, and the Local Agent application must be running for these specific workflows to execute.
-   **Security**: The agent establishes a secure, outbound-only connection to the cloud. No inbound ports need to be opened on your firewall. All actions are logged and auditable.
-   **Best For**:
    -   Automating legacy desktop software that has no API.
    -   Interacting with applications inside a private corporate network.
    -   Workflows that require access to local files on your machine.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è How the AI Engine Decides Which Model to Use

The choice is made automatically based on the **Action Step Boxes** in your workflow.

-   If a workflow **only** contains `HTTP Request`, `Browser Action`, and `LLM Prompt` steps, it will run **entirely in the cloud**.
-   If a workflow contains even **one** `Shell Command` or `Desktop Action` step, that specific step (and any subsequent steps that depend on it) must be executed by a **Local Agent**.

You can build **hybrid workflows** that perform some steps in the cloud and others on a local machine, giving you maximum flexibility.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Cloud-Based Execution | Local Agent Execution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laptop Requirement** | **OFF** | **ON** |
| **Primary Use Case** | Web Apps, APIs, Cloud Software | Desktop Apps, Local Files |
| **Scalability** | High (Thousands of parallel runs) | Limited to the local machine's capacity |
| **Availability** | 24/7, 365 days a year | Only when the user's machine is active |
| **Security** | Isolated cloud environment | Runs on user's machine with their permissions |
| **Example Action** | "Fill form on `salesforce.com`" | "Click 'Save' in QuickBooks Desktop" |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion: The Best of Both Worlds

This hybrid architecture ensures the AI Engine is both **powerful and universally compatible**.

-   For **90% of modern business tasks** involving web and cloud applications, you can set your workflows to run 24/7 and completely forget about them, knowing they are executing reliably in the cloud.
-   For that **10% of critical tasks** tied to specific desktop software, the Local Agent provides a secure bridge, ensuring no process is left behind.

This flexibility allows the AI Engine to be a single, unified platform for automating **every aspect** of your business operations.
