# üöÄ AI Engine: Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the phased implementation plan to build the AI Engine, from a core automation tool to an intelligent, adaptive, enterprise-ready platform. The roadmap is based on a "Digital Employee" first approach, prioritizing universal automation capabilities before layering on advanced AI and integrations.

---

## üéØ **Phase 1: Core Automation Foundation (The "Digital Employee")**

**Priority:** üî• **CRITICAL**  
**Timeline:** 3-4 Weeks  
**Goal:** Build a robust engine that can reliably replicate human actions on any desktop or web application using mouse and keyboard control. This is the universal foundation for all future intelligence.

| Deliverable | Description | Priority | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1. Enhanced Desktop Runner** | Implement a production-grade `DesktopRunner` using PyAutoGUI. It must handle clicks, typing, hotkeys, screen region detection, and window management. | High | Not Started |
| **1.2. Enhanced Browser Runner** | Implement a `BrowserRunner` using Playwright. It must support headless/headed modes, form filling, data extraction, and complex navigation. | High | Not Started |
| **1.3. Universal Recording Agent** | Develop a cross-platform agent that captures low-level events (mouse clicks, keystrokes, window titles) without making assumptions about the application. | High | Not Started |
| **1.4. Basic Workflow Engine** | Create the initial `WorkflowEngine` capable of executing a linear sequence of recorded desktop and browser actions. | High | Not Started |
| **1.5. Foundational Test Suite** | Develop unit and integration tests for both the Desktop and Browser runners to ensure reliability. | High | Not Started |
| **1.6. Simple Execution UI** | A minimal internal tool or CLI to trigger a recorded workflow and view the raw output log. | Medium | Not Started |

## üß† **Phase 2: Intelligent Learning & Workflow Generation**

**Priority:** üî• **HIGH**  
**Timeline:** 4-6 Weeks (After Phase 1)  
**Goal:** Transform raw recordings into structured, editable, and intelligent workflows. This phase gives the AI its "brain".

| Deliverable | Description | Priority | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1. AI Learning Engine** | Develop the core AI component that analyzes raw recording data to identify patterns, group actions, and infer user intent (e.g., "User is logging into Salesforce"). | High | Not Started |
| **2.2. Dynamic Module Generator** | Create the `DynamicModuleGenerator` that takes the AI's analysis and writes executable, sandboxed Python files for each action step box. | High | Not Started |
| **2.3. Automated Test Generation** | The generator must also create a corresponding `pytest` file for each generated module to validate its logic in a mocked environment before it can be executed. | High | Not Started |
| **2.4. Confidence Scoring System** | Implement a system where the AI assigns a confidence score (0-100%) to its understanding of each step. This metric will be crucial for the UI. | High | Not Started |
| **2.5. Re-recording Request Logic** | If confidence is low for a specific part of a process, the engine should be ableto flag it and request that the user re-record that specific segment for clarity. | Medium | Not Started |
| **2.6. Scenario Detection** | Enhance the AI Learning Engine to detect potential branches or decision points in a workflow (e.g., "User handled both a 'Success' and 'Error' pop-up at this stage"). | Medium | Not Started |

## üìö **Phase 3: Contextual Awareness (RAG & LangChain)**

**Priority:** üü¢ **MEDIUM**  
**Timeline:** 3-4 Weeks (After Phase 2)  
**Goal:** Enable the AI to ingest, understand, and use user-specific documents (PDFs, emails, etc.) to make context-aware decisions.

| Deliverable | Description | Priority | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1. RAG Engine (`rag_engine.py`)** | Build the core RAG system using LangChain for document loading (PDFs, TXT, Web), text splitting, and embedding generation. | High | Not Started |
| **3.2. Vector Store Integration** | Implement FAISS for local, secure, and tenant-isolated vector storage. Each user's knowledge base is kept separate. | High | Not Started |
| **3.3. Data Source API** | Create API endpoints for users to upload documents and manage their knowledge base data sources. | High | Not Started |
| **3.4. RAG-Aware LLM Runner** | Enhance the `LLMRunner` to automatically query the RAG engine for context before generating a response, providing grounded, factual answers. | Medium | Not Started |
| **3.5. RAG Decision Runner** | Implement a new `RAGDecisionRunner` that uses retrieved context to make intelligent choices between multiple outcomes (e.g., assess risk from a financial report). | Medium | Not Started |

## üñ•Ô∏è **Phase 4: User-Facing Platform & UI**

**Priority:** üî• **HIGH** (Parallel with Phase 2/3)  
**Timeline:** 6-8 Weeks  
**Goal:** Create an intuitive, business-focused web interface that hides all technical complexity from the end-user.

| Deliverable | Description | Priority | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4.1. Main Dashboard UI** | Design and build the main dashboard showing key metrics, recent activity, and system status. | High | Not Started |
| **4.2. Intelligent Recording Interface** | A simple, clean UI with "Start/Stop Recording" buttons. The focus is on the user performing their job, not on the technology. | High | Not Started |
| **4.3. Visual Workflow Display** | A canvas that displays the AI-generated "Action Step Boxes" in real-time as the user records. It should show the business logic, not the underlying code. | High | Not Started |
| **4.4. Action Box Editor** | Allow users to click on any AI-generated box to edit the high-level description, refine the AI's understanding, or add notes and scenarios. | High | Not Started |
| **4.5. Live Execution Monitoring** | A view that shows the workflow executing step-by-step, highlighting the current action box and displaying live outputs or status updates. | High | Not Started |
| **4.6. AI Confidence Visualization** | Display the AI's confidence score for each step and for the overall workflow, with clear indicators for steps that may need re-recording. | Medium | Not Started |
| **4.7. Dynamic Integration Panel** | A panel where the AI suggests potential API integrations based on the applications it has observed the user interacting with. | Low | Not Started |

## üè¢ **Phase 5: Enterprise Readiness & Deployment**

**Priority:** üü¢ **MEDIUM** (Ongoing throughout the project)  
**Timeline:** 4-5 Weeks (Can run in parallel)  
**Goal:** Ensure the platform is secure, scalable, and easily deployable to a production environment like Google Cloud.

| Deliverable | Description | Priority | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5.1. Authentication & RBAC** | Implement the full JWT authentication, role-based access control, and tenant isolation system. | High | Not Started |
| **5.2. Production Docker Environment** | Finalize the `docker-compose.prod.yml` with PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, and optimized, secure container builds. | High | Not Started |
| **5.3. GCP Deployment Automation** | Create and test the `scripts/deploy-gcp.sh` script for one-command deployment to Google Cloud Run and Cloud SQL. | High | Not Started |
| **5.4. Monitoring & Observability Stack** | Deploy and configure the Prometheus & Grafana stack to monitor application health, performance, and business KPIs. | Medium | Not Started |
| **5.5. CI/CD Pipeline** | Set up the GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, security scanning, and deployment to staging and production environments. | Medium | Not Started |
| **5.6. Audit Logging** | Implement comprehensive audit logging for all user actions, workflow executions, and security-related events. | Medium | Not Started |
